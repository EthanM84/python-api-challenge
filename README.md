## Introduction

In this analysis, we explore weather data for different cities and examine the relationship between various weather parameters. The analysis includes the following steps:

1. Data collection: We use an API to gather weather data for a list of cities.
2. Data cleaning: We clean and preprocess the collected data to ensure consistency and accuracy.
3. Data visualization: We create visualizations to explore and understand the weather patterns in the selected cities.

## Data

The weather data used in this analysis is sourced from an API that provides current weather information for cities worldwide. The data includes parameters such as temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed. The dataset contains information for multiple cities, allowing for comparative analysis.

## Dependencies

To run the analysis code, the following dependencies are required:

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Requests
- Gmaps (Google Maps API)

Please ensure that these dependencies are installed before running the code.

## Usage

To use this code, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies as mentioned in the Dependencies section.
3. Obtain an API key for the weather data API and update the code with your API key.
4. Run the code to collect and analyze the weather data.

## Results

The analysis generates visualizations that provide insights into the weather patterns of the selected cities. The visualizations include scatter plots, bar charts, and maps, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of the weather conditions.

Some of the key findings from the analysis include:

- Relationship between temperature and latitude
- Distribution of humidity across cities
- Correlation between cloudiness and wind speed

Detailed findings and interpretations can be found in the analysis code and accompanying visualizations.

    <h1>Vacation Analysis</h1>
    <p>This project performs a vacation analysis to help users plan their ideal vacation destinations. It utilizes weather data and geographical information to recommend suitable travel destinations based on user preferences.</p>

    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>The Vacation Analysis project aims to provide users with insights into vacation destinations by analyzing weather conditions and geographical data. It utilizes APIs to gather weather information and perform data analysis to recommend suitable travel destinations based on user preferences.</p>

    <h2>Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Weather Data Retrieval: The project retrieves weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API based on user-specified parameters such as temperature range, humidity, and cloudiness.</li>
        <li>City Selection: The project generates a list of cities based on randomly generated latitude and longitude coordinates using the citipy library.</li>
        <li>Data Analysis: The project performs data analysis on the retrieved weather data, including visualizations and statistical calculations.</li>
        <li>Visualization: The project uses matplotlib and gmaps libraries to create visualizations such as scatter plots, heatmaps, and marker maps to display weather and geographical data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Installation</h2>
    <p>To run the Vacation Analysis project, follow these steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Clone the project repository from GitHub.</li>
        <li>Install the required dependencies by running <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code>.</li>
        <li>Obtain an API key from OpenWeatherMap (<a href="https://openweathermap.org/">https://openweathermap.org/</a>) and update the <code>config.py</code> file with your API key.</li>
        <li>Run the main script, <code>vacation_analysis.py</code>, to perform the vacation analysis and generate the recommended destinations.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Usage</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Set your preferences: Specify your desired temperature range, humidity, cloudiness, and other criteria in the <code>vacation_analysis.py</code> script.</li>
        <li>Run the script: Execute the <code>vacation_analysis.py</code> script to perform the vacation analysis.</li>
        <li>View the recommendations: The script will generate visualizations and recommendations for suitable vacation destinations based on your preferences. These recommendations can include cities with favorable weather conditions and other relevant information.</li>
        <li>Plan your vacation: Based on the recommendations, plan your vacation by selecting your preferred destination from
