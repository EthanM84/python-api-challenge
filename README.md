## Introduction

In this analysis, we explore weather data for different cities and examine the relationship between various weather parameters. The analysis includes the following steps:

1. Data collection: We use an API to gather weather data for a list of cities.
2. Data cleaning: We clean and preprocess the collected data to ensure consistency and accuracy.
3. Data visualization: We create visualizations to explore and understand the weather patterns in the selected cities.

## Data

The weather data used in this analysis is sourced from an API that provides current weather information for cities worldwide. The data includes parameters such as temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed. The dataset contains information for multiple cities, allowing for comparative analysis.

## Dependencies

To run the analysis code, the following dependencies are required:

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Requests
- Gmaps (Google Maps API)

Please ensure that these dependencies are installed before running the code.

## Usage

To use this code, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies as mentioned in the Dependencies section.
3. Obtain an API key for the weather data API and update the code with your API key.
4. Run the code to collect and analyze the weather data.

## Results

The analysis generates visualizations that provide insights into the weather patterns of the selected cities. The visualizations include scatter plots, bar charts, and maps, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of the weather conditions.

Some of the key findings from the analysis include:

- Relationship between temperature and latitude
- Distribution of humidity across cities
- Correlation between cloudiness and wind speed

Detailed findings and interpretations can be found in the analysis code and accompanying visualizations.
